🎓 Alumni Intelligence Network (AIN)

AIN is a smart, institute-verified platform that connects students and alumni for guidance, mentorship, community learning, and skill growth.
Unlike LinkedIn, AIN is a closed ecosystem designed specifically for colleges, focusing on career clarity, mentorship, and real learning from alumni journeys.

The platform introduces two unique concepts:

⭐ Alumni Journey Graph

A visual timeline showing how alumni progressed year-by-year — skills learned, projects, internships, job switches, and key milestones. This gives students a real, practical roadmap.

⭐ Smart Matchmaking Engine (SME)

Recommends the best alumni, communities, and workshops based on a student’s interests, skills, and career goals.

✨ Core Features

Verified alumni & student accounts

Personalized alumni recommendations

Domain-based communities (Web Dev, Finance, UPSC, etc.)

Two-way mentorship (request + invite)

Real-time chat with file sharing

Alumni-hosted workshops (optional)

Admin panel for analytics & user management

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit
Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT
Others: Cloudinary (media), Nodemailer, Socket.io

🚀 Purpose

AIN helps students make better career decisions, get mentorship from seniors, and follow proven paths.
For alumni, it provides a simple way to guide juniors, host sessions, and stay connected with their college.

AIN builds a practical, meaningful bridge between students and alumni — something that typical social platforms do not offer.
